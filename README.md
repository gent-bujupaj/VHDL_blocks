# VHDL_blocks
Different components block for VHDL
This Repo containts several blocks(components), which describe different architectural designs. All of the components have been written in Vivado and all have
been tested for their correctness. So, these components are either correct by-construction or are throughly tested through simulation.Furtheremore, there are some 
examples where I instanciated these different components to a bigger module to create a more complex behavior.
